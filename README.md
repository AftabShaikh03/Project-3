## HR Data Analytics 

 # Objectives - #  
This project is related to HR domain and the data analysis of employees from the company name AtliQ Technologies.

In this I have to designed a power BI dashboard to track employee data for HR team. It includes working hours, attendance, performance, and leaves etc.

This is going to reduce a lot time approx. 3 – 4 hours of daily work for HR team. 

step - 1 

It includes some Excel work also and that is as follow - 

I import all data into excel workbook  and categorized into parts and differentiated with shot form code like –

WFH – work from home , SL – sick leave , WFO – work from office , P – present , PL – paid leave etc. 

And done some work on it and made it in structured manner and remove all the error and duplicates in it so that I can import it into Power BI desktop for dashboard creation.

I have attached the excel file in .xlsx format so that you can view  my work on it.


Step - 2 

Power BI comes for dashboard - 

After importing excel file of dataset into power bi desktop it showed me in table view then I did some work on it and made it better for model preparation .

Before making model for dashboard, I have created extra columns like percentage of categories and then I made model .

There after I created measures for better dashboard and insights, I created measures which is showing  % WFH , %WFO , %Attendance , %SL  etc.

The last  but not least step that dashboard setup and creation. I have made dashboard setup according to me that shows  %Attendance , %WFH , %SL  of overall employees for three months in this I have setup the graphs also that shows overtime. 

After that I setup for individual months , employees  , days and dates so that I can get better understanding while putting out the insights from that dashboard .   
 
 I have also attached the power Bi dashboard in .pbix format so that you can check and see how it works.

 Step - 3 

 # Insights are - 

 1. Overall Workforce Engagement - 

Majority of employees maintained high presence (P) across all three months.

Attendance consistency shows good discipline & low absenteeism.
Set Employees show 100% presence (only weekly offs & holidays) → exemplary commitment.

A few employees have higher absenteeism through PL/SL/WFH, worth discussing in HR reviews.

2. Leave Trends - 
Paid Leave (PL) and Sick Leave (SL) usage was minimal overall.

Very low usage of Birthday Leave (BL), Festival Leave (FFL), and Bereavement Leave (BRL) → these policies exist but are rarely utilized.

Bo Cordova (example from sample) shows relatively higher PL and WFH usage compared to peers → potential work-life balance need.

3. Work from Home (WFH) Insights - 

WFH was taken selectively by few employees (e.g., in April).

Indicates that the WFH policy was flexible but not widely adopted.

Can be leveraged as an engagement tool for employees who need flexibility.

4. Weekly Offs & Holidays – 

Employees consistently received 8–9 weekly offs per month.

Public holidays were minimal during this quarter.

Clear balance maintained between workdays and rest days.


# Recommendations - 

Promote Balanced Leave Usage – Encourage employees to use earned leave for rest, preventing burnout.

WFH Policy Review – Since WFH is underutilized, management can decide whether to strengthen or reduce it.

Recognition for High Attendance – Reward employees with consistent 100% presence.

Wellness Checks – Employees with frequent sick leave may benefit from health & wellness initiatives.
